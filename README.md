### General Description
Color 3 click is a mikroBUS add-on board with a TCS3771 color sensor (also known as a light-to-digital converter) and a narrow beam Infrared LED. The circuit can also function as a proximity sensor. 

TCS3771 is a RGBC sensor: it can detect Red, Green, Blue and clear light. The IC performs well under a variety of lighting conditions. For example, it can be covered with different attenuation materials.

As a proximity sensor it has a large dynamic range of operation. It can take short distance measurements behind dark glass; or it can be configured for longer distance measurement, for example, human presence detection in front of monitors or laptops.

For power-saving, TCS3771 has an internal state machine that can put the device into a low power mode between successive RGBC and proximity measurements.

TCS3771 is also fast enough to give off proximity information at a high rate of repetition. This makes it useful for proximity detection in portable devices (such as a phone coming near to a speakerâ€™s ear).

Color 3 click communicates with the target MCU through the mikroBUS I2C interface, with additional functionality provided by an INT pin. Designed to use a 3.3 power supply only.

Applications
RGBC color sensing and proximity sensing (suitable for portable devices)

Key features
- TCS3771 IC and IR Diode
- RGBC color sensing and proximity detection
- I2C, INT
- 3.3V power supply

Key benefits
- Power-saving options
- Fast operation (suitable for proximity detection in portable devices)
- Proximity detection for short or longer ranges (up to half a meter)
- Ready-to-use examples save development time
